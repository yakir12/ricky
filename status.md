I have an ok way to test performance.
I can change the settings of the camera to 4 distinct modes to see which works best for our needs.
I'd like to try and change the way I test it so it resembles more what we will eventually do in the real experiment.
My goal is to be able to confidently answer which settings works best for us, and how many RPI we'll need.
